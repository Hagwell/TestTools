<div><pre>               Single Record Testing Process 
               When looking to run testing for a new project, the following steps should be taken to ensure, that 
               where possible, Automation and API testing are taken into consideration and implemented as soon 
               as possible: 

               User Requirements Review 
               Ideally, prior to any backlog refinement meeting, the Lead Test Analysts, (along with some tech/dev 
               support if possible), will look to review the requirements and decide upon the following factors: 

                   •   Does the requirement contain enough information to decipher the desired functionality, and 
                       where possible, suggest any alterations that would be required? 
                   •   Are there any technical elements that need to be investigated prior to testing, e.g. SQL, API, 
                       configurational (app files) testing, etc? 
                   •   Is the project suitable for automation, with regards to the scale of the project, efficiency 
                       gained from automation, is the code likely to change often, how complex is the functionality, 
                       etc? 

               Technical Elements Review 
               Once accepted into a sprint, Lead Test Analysts will look to identify areas within the requirements 
               that can be tested efficiently using testing tools, such as SQL: 

                   •   SQL databases used within the requirement, e.g. calls to reference data, user account details, 
                       audit logging, environmental changes (Web Services, etc). 
                   •   Web Services/API endpoints used within the requirement, e.g. Can API testing against an 
                       endpoint be used as comparison against those objects within the requirement? 
                   •   Data Required to fully test the requirement. 

               Areas where this can be added, will be highlighted and any API/SQL projects and required data 
               should be generated and shared with the Test Analyst for inclusion in any test cases. 

               Manual Testing Review 
               Once accepted into a sprint, the Test Analyst will also look to begin writing the test cases in Gherkin 
               syntax, ensuring a review of these is undertaken by a Technical Analyst to ensure it conforms to the 
               current Automation Framework. Even when there are areas within an automated project that will 
               require manual testing, these areas should be fully reviewed from a technical aspect, as it may be 
               possible these can be automated later in the project lifecycle. 

               There will be projects where, it will be impossible to automate testing straight away, due to many 
               factors such as, work required in the background any application to successfully implement the 
               requested functionality, meaning there is no physical UI layer with which to interact. Therefore, we 
               need to ensure all projects are fully updated with manual test cases, written in Gherkin syntax, to 
               enable a manual process in the event of automation failure/delay. 

               Automation Review 
               When looking at automation, the size/complexity of the project and the available resource within the 
               Test Team may require a single resource to provide both roles. In these instances, we should look to 
               ensure another member within the team is available to assist with any review, and all automation 
               reviews performed should align with the following: 

</pre></div>
<div><pre>                   •   At which stage will automation be possible? 
                   •   Can the UI be accessed prior to availability in SIT/Can we access the dev code? 
                   •   Does the project Parameters class require updating? 
                   •   Can SQL/API testing be brought into the automation project, e.g. API testing via JSON, SQL 
                       Testing via DbConnect)? 

               Final Project Review 
               Prior to delivery of any project to UAT, a full review should be conducted with all involved parties, to 
               review the following: 

                   •   Complexity of project and if Automation assists with validation. 
                   •   Size of the project and where Automation provides efficiency compared to manual testing. 
                   •   Time taken to automate, and testing coverage provided within the project. 
                   •   Can the overall process be improved?
