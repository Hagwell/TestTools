<div><pre>               New Starter first day 
               On any new user’s first day, we should look to ensure they come into the Cardiff office, to take 
               ownership of the laptop. This will also allow for a meet and greet with the new starter, and to assist 
               with the setup of account, hardware and any required software (please see below). 

               Required Software 

                   •   Postman 
                   •   SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 
                   •   Visual Studio - Including .Net Framework 4.7.2 &gt; .Net Core 8 - Specflow and Nunit extensions 
                   •   Corresponding .NET SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-
                       sdks 

               Where this is not possible, the Test Team Principal/Lead Tests Analysts will look to gain access of the 
               new starter account and equipment, with the aim of pre-logging and installing any necessary 
               software or account access. This will include: 

                   •   Taking ownership of new user account details and laptop by visiting the office. 
                   •   Accessing the new starter accounts while in the office, to ensure any account/hardware 
                       grouping is locally cached. 
                   •   Installing any required software. 
                   •   Ensuring any VPN software is installed. 
                   •   Laptop is handed over for delivery to New Starter (ensuring the laptop delivery is prior to the 
                       individual’s start date), this is usually handled by Client Services.
